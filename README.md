Randomize Project is a versatile tool designed to generate random project structures tailored for penetration testers, red teamers, and cybersecurity professionals. This tool helps you quickly create unpredictable directory templates that simulate real-world project environments, sparking creative solutions for security testing and development.

---

## Overview

In the dynamic field of cybersecurity, predictable project structures can limit creativity and hinder realistic simulations. Randomize Project allows you to generate a randomized directory tree with customizable parameters, enabling you to test, develop, and audit security solutions in environments that mimic the chaos of real-world scenarios.

Whether you need to create a randomized template for a new pentesting engagement or simply want to experiment with diverse project setups, Randomize Project streamlines the process, so you can focus on the critical challenges.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eyvert58/randomize-project.git
    cd randomize-project
    ```
2. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. **Install required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## Usage

Run the tool from the command line:
```bash
python randomize.py [options]
```

## Options

- `--depth <n>`: Set the maximum depth of the directory structure.
- `--max-folders <n>`: Limit the maximum number of folders per level.
- `--seed <value>`: Provide a seed for reproducible randomization (optional).

**Example:**
```bash
python randomize.py --depth 4 --max-folders 3
```

This command generates a random project structure with a maximum depth of 4 and up to 3 folders per level.
